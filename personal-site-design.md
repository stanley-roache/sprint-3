How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I'd like for people to:
- Immediately read/see one or two things that appeal to their interest, 
- be able to navigate around the site easily
- Not feel overwhelmed by content at the outset, I think this means not too much on one page.
- Enjoy the experience of moving through the site and the look of it.

How will you build your site to support this experience?

I think it has a lot to do with simplicity, in layout and also in navigation structure. I don't want too much info on the page at any one time and also I want it to feel easy and intuitive to look for more and traverse between things.
I want each page to display information and material that is attractive, provides an enjoyable flowthrough and is discrete enough
in length that users don't get bored.

Implicit over Explicit
Process over Product
Play over.. Pressure?
